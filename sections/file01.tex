\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Using LaTeX}
This document will help you format your assessment as nicely as possible.\
In general, different chapters are structured using "subsections." These can have as many levels as you like, so "subsubsections" are also possible, for example. \
You can divide the different sections of your assessment into different documents. It should be noted that the name should follow the pattern "fileXY." X and Y should be replaced with numbers between 0 and 9 in the name. The documents should also be numbered in ascending order, starting with "01," followed by "02" up to a maximum of "99." If this structuring is followed, the individual documents will be automatically inserted into the final document.
